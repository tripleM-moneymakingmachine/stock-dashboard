   → AI labs & platforms → the broader economy. Particles flow along the links: blue for chips, compute and
   models moving downstream, green for money flowing back upstream. Hover or tap a node to trace its links

    { l: [4], t: "Hyperscalers, neoclouds and colocation firms own the AI factories. They spend hundreds of billions a year on capex and rent the capacity out, much of it to a handful of AI labs under multi-year contracts." },
    { l: [5], t: "AI labs train models on that compute and serve them through chat apps and APIs; platforms like Palantir connect models to a company's own data, and security firms like Zscaler make it safe to use." },

Users and companies pay for subscriptions and API calls; labs pay clouds for compute; clouds spend that on racks, chips, memory and power; chip makers pay TSMC; TSMC buys ASML's tools.
